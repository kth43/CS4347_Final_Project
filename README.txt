Main.py: Runs 1 iteration of program with n features cut, decided by argument passed in command line (python main.py n). This WILL NOT write results into results directory.
MainLooped.py: Runs 15 iterations of models, you can change range inside by editing overarching for. This WILL write most recent results in results directory and will save plotted graphs as new .png files

IMPORTANT: To run the program, you need to download the dataset at https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud
and store it into a folder called data in the same directory as main.py and mainLooped.py
